# Pi Web Access - Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- PDF extraction via `unpdf` - fetches PDFs from URLs and saves as markdown to `~/Downloads/`
  - Extracts text, metadata (title, author), page count
  - Supports PDFs up to 20MB (vs 5MB for HTML)
  - Handles arxiv URLs with smart title fallback

### Fixed

- Plain text URL detection now uses hostname check instead of substring match

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- RSC (React Server Components) content extraction for Next.js App Router pages
  - Parses flight data from `<script>self.__next_f.push([...])</script>` tags
  - Reconstructs markdown with headings, tables, code blocks, links
  - Handles chunk references and nested components
  - Falls back to RSC extraction when Readability fails
- Content-type validation rejects binary files (images, PDFs, audio, video, zip)
- 5MB response size limit (checked via Content-Length header) to prevent memory issues

### Fixed

- `fetch_content` now handles plain text URLs (raw.githubusercontent.com, gist.githubusercontent.com, any text/plain response) instead of failing with "Could not extract readable content"
