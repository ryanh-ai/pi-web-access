## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

  - Extracts text, metadata (title, author), page count
  - Supports PDFs up to 20MB (vs 5MB for HTML)

### Added

- RSC (React Server Components) content extraction for Next.js App Router pages

  - Handles chunk references and nested components
  - Falls back to RSC extraction when Readability fails
- Content-type validation rejects binary files (images, PDFs, audio, video, zip)
- 5MB response size limit (checked via Content-Length header) to prevent memory issues

### Fixed

- `fetch_content` now handles plain text URLs (raw.githubusercontent.com, gist.githubusercontent.com, any text/plain response) instead of failing with "Could not extract readable content"

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-11

- Activity monitor widget (`Ctrl+Shift+O`) showing live request/response activity
  - Displays last 10 API calls and URL fetches with status codes and timing
